---------------- Part 1 ----------------

-- Implement the seven RECURSIVE predicates/operations on RegExp given in
-- Section 3.3 of the notes; call them empty, uni, byp, inf, revrs, lq,
-- and nep. Each should begin with a type declaration. Include several tests
-- for each function. Then implement one more not given there: purity.

-- Purity. A regular expression is *pure* if every string matching r

---------------- Part 2 ----------------

-- Implement the two matching algorithms given in Section 3.4 of the notes,
-- where the second algorithm is the modified one I posted on Piazza (@96).
-- Call them match1 and match2. Start by implementing splits:

-- splits xs = list of all possible splits of xs, in order. For example,
-- splits "bc" =  [("","bc"), ("b","c"), ("bc","")]
-- splits "abc" = [("","abc"), ("a","bc"), ("ab","c"), ("abc","")]
splits :: [a] -> [([a], [a])]
splits xs = [ (take r list, drop r list) | r<- [0..length xs], list <- [xs] ]

match1 :: RegExp -> String -> Bool
match1 Empty w = False
match1 (Let a) w 
  | (length w == 1) = (Let a == (toRE w))
  | otherwise = False
match1 (Union r1 r2) w = match1 r1 w || match1 r2 w
match1 (Cat r1 r2) w = or [(match1 r1 w1) && (match1 r2 w2) | (w1, w2) <- splits w]
match1 (Star r1) w =  (null w) || or[(match1 r1 w1) && (match1 (Star r1) w2) | (w1,w2) <- splits w, not(null w1)]



-- Helper function
match2' :: [RegExp] -> Bool -> String -> Bool
match2' r b w | null r = null w
match2' ((Empty):rs) b w = False
match2' ((Let x):rs) b w 
  | length w >= 1 = (Let x == toRE [head w]) && match2' rs False (tail(w))
  | otherwise = False
match2' ((Union r1 r2):rs) b w = match2' (r1:rs) b w || match2' (r2:rs) b w

match2 :: RegExp -> String -> Bool
match2 r w = match2' (r:[]) False w



-- Some regular expressions for testing. Also, test them on other solutions
-- to the exercises of Section 3.2 (as many as you can get). 

sigma = ['a', 'b']                -- Alphabet used in all examples below

ab   = toRE "aa.bb.+*"            -- every letter is duplicated
ttla = toRE "ab+*a.ab+.ab+."      -- third to last letter is a
ena  = toRE "b*a.b*.a.*b*."       -- even number of a's
bb1  = toRE "aba.+*b.b.aab.+*."   -- contains bb exactly once


-- For your tests, you may also find the following helpful. For example,
-- you can generate all strings of length 10 (or 20) or less and then test
-- to see whether match1 r w == memb (lol w) (lang_of r) for each such w.

-- All strings on sigma of length <= n (useful for testing)
strings :: Int -> [String]
strings n = concatMap str [0..n] where
  str 0 = [""]
  str n = [a:w | a <- sigma, w <- str (n-1)]
